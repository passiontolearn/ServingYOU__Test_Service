Note that there's quite some coupling here (Web Server and App code in the same Module file etc'...)  
and [this](https://medium.com/@HolmesLaurence/integrating-node-and-python-6b8454bfc272 "Integrating Node and Python (medium.com)") or using [Go](https://golang.org/) is probably a much better way of doing it...

Apache + Tomcat + Application Server (Servlets, JSP etc') and a MySQL DB ...

The Experience of using Microsoft's ASP/ASPX in Visual Studio (2010) was way more friendlier I have to say...
